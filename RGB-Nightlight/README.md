RGB Nightlight
==============

RGB-Nightlight.ino

Programmable RGB LED that reacts to light levels based on threshold of a photoresistor.

The goal here is to have a custom nightlight that will automatically turn on when it gets dark
and allows you to easily choose which colors you would like to see and their fade values and rate.
